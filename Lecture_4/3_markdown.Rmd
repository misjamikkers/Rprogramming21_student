In this notebook we will exercise using Markdown to format our documents.

## What is markdown

In Markdown you can just create plain text, but you can also do some formatting. That's what this lesson is about.

*Remember you can google everything*

A good ["cheat sheet can be found here"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf)


## Formatting

For starters, it is possible to simply type text.

## Structure

But it is also possible to add structure to the text:

```
# Chapter
## Section
### Subsection
#### etc
##### etc
```

# Chapter
## Section
### Subsection
#### etc
##### etc

<br>

### Lists

```
* unordered list 
* item 2
  + sub-item 1
  + sub-item 2
  
1. ordered list
2. item 2
  + sub-item 1
  + sub-item 2
```

**Exercise**:

Now try to make a list of main points (1,2,3) and sub-points (3a, 3b) and knit to see the result.


### Text formatting

**Exercise**:

Make one word in this sentence bold.


### Tables

```
First name | Surname |
----------- | ------------ |
Gertjan | Verhoeven |
Misja | Mikkers |
```

**Exercise**:

a. Copy this table
b. Add a line with your own name
c. Add a column with the title `Role` and fill in the roles after the names (valid roles are teacher, student, or teaching assistant)


## Hyperlinks and images


### Hyperlinks


**Exercise**:

Insert a hyperlink to the Tilburg University website.


### Pictures


**Exercise**:

Insert the photo of Donald Knuth, the inventor of a predecessor of R Notebooks. The photo is in the images folder.

### Formulas

Write this image as an inline formula:

![](images/formula.png)

### Starting a new page

You can force a pagebreak (new page) using this command.
This only works when you convert to PDF.
